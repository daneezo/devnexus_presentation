## 4 Workflow Patterns

1. **Translate → Synthesize → Act** — Raw data to executive insights to action plans
2. **Build → Test → Iterate** — Generate code, test it, fix failures with AI
3. **Research → Evaluate → Decide** — Analyze materials, weigh evidence, make decisions
4. **Draft → Fact-Check → Refine** — Create content, verify claims, polish output
